\section{Database Description}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item ER-model of the Database Design

    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ER}
    \end{center}

    \pagebreak

  \item Relational Schema for the Database

    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{RelationalSchema}
    \end{center}

    The bold field refers to the primary keys of the relational schema

  \item Levels of normalization for each table:
    All tables achieve BCNF.

  \item Indices for the Database

    We chose the Tree-based index for our BOOK table since the tree-based index is good for looking up values based on range tests. It will speed up our queries when we want to retrieve the book based on the range of the year or the range of the price. Also it is not too bad for looking up values based on equality tests, so it also can slightly speed up our queries when we are trying to look up books based on the titles, categories, authors, and publishers.

  \item Views for the Database

    \begin{itemize}
    \item View A

      Description: This view is able to show all the titles and their dates of purchase made by each customer. And this could be useful to make book recommendations for a customer by looking at his or her purchase history.

      Relational algebra expression:
      \begin{align*}
        &\textit{R1} \leftarrow \textit{PURCHASE} \bowtie_{\textit{Customer} = \textit{Email}} \textit{Customer}\\
        &\textit{R2} \leftarrow \textit{BOOK} \bowtie_{\textit{Isbn} = \textit{Book}} \textit{R1}\\
        &\textit{Result} \leftarrow \pi_{\textit{Name, Title, Date}}\textit{R2}
      \end{align*}

    \item View B

      Description: This view is able to show the total number of books purchased by each customer. And this could be useful to see if this customer deserves a gift by making a certain amount of purchases in this store.

      Relational algebra expression:
      \begin{align*}
        &\textit{R1} \leftarrow \textit{PURCHASE} \bowtie_{\textit{Customer} = \textit{Email}} \textit{Customer}\\

\section{Appendix: Graded Checkpoints}

\subsection{Checkpoint 1}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Based on the requirements given in the project overview, list the entities to be modeled in this database.  For each entity, provide a list of associated attributes.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item BOOK (\underline{Isbn}, Title, Author(s), Year, Price, Category)
  \item PUBLISHER (\underline{Name}, Phone, Address)
  \item CUSTOMER (\underline{Id}, \underline{Email}, Name, Address, Phone)
  \item INVENTORY (Location, Quantity)
  \item SALE\_RECORD (\underline{Transaction\_Id}, Date, Card\_Type)
  \end{itemize}

\item Based on the requirements given in the project overview, what are the various relationships between entities?  (For example, “CUSTOMER entities purchase BOOK entities”).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item PUBLISHER entities publish BOOK entities
    \item CUSTOMER entities purchase BOOK entities, create SALE\_RECORD entities (ternary relation)
    \item BOOK entities stores at INVENTORY entities
  \end{itemize}

\item Propose at least two additional entities that it would be useful for this database to model beyond the scope of the project requirements.  Provide a list of possible attributes for the additional entities and possible relationships they may have with each other and the rest of the entities in the database. Give a brief, one sentence rationale for why adding these entities would be interesting/useful to the stakeholders for this database project.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item DISCOUNT (Percentage, Buy\_Limit)

    Additional Relationships: DISCOUNT entities applies on BOOK entities
    Applying a DISCOUNT entities to BOOK entities, the final cost of that BOOK entities could be calculated automatically.

  \item ACCOUNT (weak) (\underline{A}c\underline{c}t\_N\underline{o}, Reward\_Point, Recommendation\_List, membership)

    Additional Relationships: CUSTOMER entities may have ACCOUNT entities
    Enabling CUSTOMER entities to have their unique account could help the stakeholders to check information of a customer quicker when the customer is trying to make a purchase.

  \item GIFT（weak) (Type)

    Additional Relationships: BOOKSTORE entities reward GIFT entities to CUSTOMER entities
    By applying GIFT entities, customers get rewarded once they spend a certain amount at the bookstore, which will maintain a good customer service.

  \end{itemize}

\item Give at least four examples of some informal queries/reports that it might be useful for this database might be used to generate. Include one example for each of the additional entities you proposed in question 3 above.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Report all current inventory
    \item Report sales summary
    \item List all current accounts with membership
    \item Show all discounted books
    \item List all books from certain category
    \item List all books by certain author
    \item List all gifts that are rewarded to customer
  \end{itemize}

\item Suppose we want to add a new publisher to the database.  How would we do that given the entities and relationships you’ve outlined above?  Given your above description, is it possible to add a new publisher to your database without knowing the title of any books they have published?  If not, revise your model to allow for publishers to be added as separate entities.

  Create PUBLISHER entities with attributes “Name”, “Phone” and “Address”, and have a relationship with BOOK entities which is PUBLISHER entities publish BOOK entities.

\item Determine at least three other informal update operations and describe what entities would need to have attributes altered and how they would need to be changed given your above descriptions.  Include one example for each of the additional entities you proposed in question 3 above.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Change the price of a BOOK
    \item Update the INVENTORY of a BOOK
    \item Add Reward\_Point for a MEMBER
    \item Change the Percentage of a DISCOUNT
    \item Change the Type of GIFT
    \item Customers update their personal information (Email, Name, Address, Phone)
    \item Account’s recommendation list can be altered according to changes in purchasing history
  \end{itemize}

\item Provide an ER diagram for your database. Make sure you include all of the entities and relationships you determined in the questions above INCLUDING the entities for question 3 above, and remember that EVERY entity in your model needs to connect to another entity in the model via some kind of relationship.

\end{enumerate}

FIX:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Yes, we can.
\item See section 1, page 1 for updated ER model.
\item See section 1, page 1 for updated ER model.
\item See section 1, page 1 for updated ER model.
\item ID is removed, See section 1, page 1 for updated ER model.
\item Yes, it is.
